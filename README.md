# Quantel Programming Language

Quantel is a programming language designed for AI and machine learning development. It utilizes a transparent architecture that exposes internal compiler states and execution data.

## Compiler and Optimizer

### 4-Stage Optimization

The compiler applies four optimization passes to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) before execution:

1. **Deep Constant Folding**: Evaluates mathematical expressions at compile-time, replacing chains like `69 + 8 + 9 * 5` with the literal result `122`.
2. **Constant Propagation**: Substitutes variable references with known constant values to reduce memory access operations.
3. **Identity Simplification**: Removes mathematically redundant operations, including `x * 1`, `x + 0`, and `x * 0`.
4. **Dead Code Elimination**: Prunes unreachable code blocks, such as logic following a `return` statement or branches within `if(false)` conditions.

### Pipeline Architecture

* **Lexical Analysis**: Converts source text into categorized tokens.
* **Syntactic Parsing**: Validates grammar and constructs the AST.
* **Semantic Analysis**: Verifies scope, variable declarations, and logical integrity.
* **Intermediate Representation**: Translates logic into Three-Address Code (TAC).
* **Execution**: Interprets the optimized AST within a sandboxed environment.

## Quantel IDE

The Quantel IDE is a development tool built to interface with the Quantel compiler's data structures.

* **Memory Mapping**: Provides a live view of the global environment, tracking variable values and memory states during execution.
* **Navigation**: Supports Jump to Definition via `Cmd/Ctrl + Click` on identifiers.
* **Search**: Integrated minimalist search overlay (`Cmd+F`) with match highlighting.
* **Instruction Inspection**: TAC Viewer displays the flattened instruction set generated by the compiler.
* **Error Reporting**: Highlights source lines associated with lexical, syntax, or semantic errors.

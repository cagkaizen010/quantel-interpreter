**Quantel Programming Language**

Quantel is a programming language designed for AI and machine learning development. It utilizes a transparent architecture that exposes internal compiler states and execution data.

**Compiler and Optimizer**
4-Stage Optimization
The compiler applies four optimization passes to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) before execution:

**Deep Constant Folding:** Evaluates mathematical expressions at compile-time, replacing chains like 69 + 8 + 9 * 5 with the literal result 122.

**Constant Propagation: **Substitutes variable references with known constant values to reduce memory access operations.

**Identity Simplification: **Removes mathematically redundant operations, including x * 1, x + 0, and x * 0.

**Dead Code Elimination: **Prunes unreachable code blocks, such as logic following a return statement or branches within if(false) conditions.

**Pipeline Architecture**
**Lexical Analysis: **Converts source text into categorized tokens.

**Syntactic Parsing: **Validates grammar and constructs the AST.

**Semantic Analysis: **Verifies scope, variable declarations, and logical integrity.

**Intermediate Representation: **Translates logic into Three-Address Code (TAC).

**Execution: **Interprets the optimized AST within a sandboxed environment.

**Quantel IDE**
The Quantel IDE is a development tool built to interface with the Quantel compiler's data structures.

**Memory Mapping: **Provides a live view of the global environment, tracking variable values and memory states during execution.

**Navigation: **Supports Jump to Definition via Cmd/Ctrl + Click on identifiers.

**Search: **Integrated minimalist search overlay (Cmd+F) with match highlighting.

**Instruction Inspection: **TAC Viewer displays the flattened instruction set generated by the compiler.

**Error Reporting: **Highlights source lines associated with lexical, syntax, or semantic errors.

**Shortcuts**
F5: Execute Pipeline (Lex, Parse, Analyze, Optimize, Run)

Cmd/Ctrl + F: Search

Cmd/Ctrl + Click: Jump to Definition
